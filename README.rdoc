== Strong Params Demo

  I've used this super basic Rails app to explain the need to sanitize your params
in your Rails application.

=== Chapters to the talk

  * What are params in a web application.
  * How are they sent to the server, typically?
  * How a client controls what params are sent to the server.
  * What strong params does to whitelist what params a client can use in a form.
